The zing of zesty bergamot, paired with punchy pink peppercorn, brings a bright burst to this fragrance. A warming and sensual sandalwood mellows the scent to a skin-soft finish.',

A master of understated sophistication in his compositions, the fascinating detail that Ellena only uses a palette of 200 ingredients is just one of his impressive attributes. Touching on the beginnings of modern perfumery, the harvesting of ingredients to the end of a fragrant creation with trademarking, production, marketing and safety regulations, Perfume: The Alchemy of Scent is a comprehensive guide that never feels too complex for the reader.
