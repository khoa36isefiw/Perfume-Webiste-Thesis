            'The key thing to be aware of when you are trying out scents to layer, is the complexity of the perfume. There are some immensely intricate fragrances out there, and although these may be beautiful alone, they may be trickier to layer. A Chanel No 5 might be heavenly alone, but when layered with Guerlain’s Mitsouko creates a complicated fragrance cocktail.',
            'You want to look for minimalistic fragrances with uncomplicated scent and ingredient formulae that aren’t too long. You can also look for scents with overlapping ingredients, two fragrances that use jasmine as a main note, for example. Try not to go for anything too complex, you could start by finding a nice soliflore, or a single-note fragrance, and layer it with another scent that has that ingredient in common.',
            'Our favourite way to layer is to find fragrances on opposite ends of the fragrance wheel – just as with colours – these will often pair beautifully. Mixing a light citrus scent with the right woody fragrance might result in something utterly irresistible. Our Essentials collection – minimalist fragrances that celebrate the simple complexity of ingredients – were designed to be blended together and make for perfect layering pairs when combining an Essential from the TOP category (fresh scent) with another Essential with a BASE category (deep scent).',

Whichever way you prefer, will lead you to your personalised fragrance.',

            'Our very own Perfumer’s Handbook had to make it on to the list. Available individually or within our Perfumer’s Atelier; a luxury collector’s box containing 50 ingredients to explore, and an accompanying Handbook which details information of all ingredients included.',
            'The book, written by Emmanuelle Moeglin and a handful of fellow perfumers and perfume experts, contains unique insights on how perfume ingredients are used in fragrances and formulae.',
            'The book traverses the most well-known and used ingredients in perfumery, from naturals like rose absolute and vetiver oil, to the cherished aroma-chemicals of the industry, Iso E Super and Calone and famous compositions such as Cassis Base.',
            'The Handbook also has a very handy section on the vocabulary of scent, a chapter on the classification of ingredients and fragrances, the origins and provenance of ingredients, all  accompanied by delightful illustrations and set out in a comprehensible format.',
            'We’ve created it so you can not only deep dive on the origins, uses, and classification of said ingredients, but also explore them with your nose, ensuring a full-circle understanding of them as you go. The perfect addition to kickstart your perfumery.',

            'We would be remiss to not mention Elisabeth de Feydeau in our list. A French historian, writer and expert in fragrance, Feydeau has been enchanted by all things olfactory from an early age. Working as a cultural advisor to Chanel and Guerlain, she has written three books on perfumery and often teaches at the Versailles School of Perfumers.',
            'Her book Les Parfums: Histoire, Anthologie, Dictionnaire (2011), although only available in French, is regarded by the EPC’s Founder, Emmanuelle, as one of the most comprehensive books on perfumery, it is in fact more an encyclopedia than a book.',
            'It follows perfume on its journey from its very beginning to its current state; neolithic pottery to travel atomisers, ancient Egyptian recipes recorded on papyrus to industrial patents. Perfume has long been an integral part of history and Feydeau explores its links with myths and ancient rituals, as well as personal hygiene and industrialization. A must-read for any French-speaking perfumers.',

            'A long read at almost 700 pages, Nose Dive fuses technical information and structures with delightfully written anecdotes on food, spices, and flowers, and is a must-read for anyone wanting to understand the reason things smell the way they do. Nose Dive is divided into five parts – Primordial smells, animal smells, plant, land and water smells in one section, and finally fragrances and food. A true deep dive into all forms of scent, not just a guide to smells we can experience now, it is also a guide to a smellscape of a different time, from the very first smells to the scent of space.',
            'Delving into chemistry and the science of scents – it has a short introduction on chemistry for any non-specialists – the book is also fused with stories that help bring the technical information to life.',
            'With entire chapters on plant volatile families, mosses, trees, grasses, weeds and flowers, detailing odorant molecules, what they smell of and where one finds them within natural ingredients – we’d say this one is for those wishing to have a true schooling in the science of scent. A sensational book for anyone looking to develop their nose, and their olfactory brain.',
