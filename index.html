                    Our nervous system – your body’s control centre, has evolved to become less
                    sensitive to recurring stimuli. Back in the day, this gave us a fighting chance
                    to deal with all the dangers we encountered. It’s why a new scent, sight,
                    texture or taste heightens our interest. Our body is saying, hang on a minute,

                    When it comes to scents, it means we always lose perspective. If you wear the
                    same fragrance daily, you’re bound to think the potency has dwindled over the
                    years, or even throughout the day. It’s why you can’t smell the scent of your
                    home, while other people will pick up on it immediately.

                    The same goes for the perfume you are wearing on your neck. Your nose and brain
                    will naturally get used to it. You may even lose the scent completely. But it’s
                    there, just as you remember it, and other people will smell it more than you
                    since they have not adapted to it!

                    If you can’t smell your perfume anymore, try to spray your fragrance on your
                    wrists or another part of your body. The trick is distancing the location from
                    your nose. This small modification can alter the chemistry and reignite your
                    detection. At the very least, the change will catch you by surprise when you
                    move around and get a fresh waft.

                    Perfumers always talk about the olfactory pyramid, and for good reason. It
                    provides the building blocks of any good perfume. But why? I hear you ask. The
                    pyramid represents the stages in which fragrances evolve. Most perfume
                    ingredients are volatile, meaning they have a shelf life.

                    Perfumes must be constructed with volatile compounds (better known as VOC or
                    volatile organic compounds) to be smelled and enjoyed in the first place. If
                    they are volatile, this means your fragrance is bound to evaporate over time.
                    Some ingredients (or molecules) evaporate quicker than others!

                    If you love these deeper scents, your perfume probably lasts longer than the
                    average. Stronger scents will have a robust sillage for others to enjoy (or
                    hate!). It is common for these notes to last all day, at the very least, a few
                    hours.
