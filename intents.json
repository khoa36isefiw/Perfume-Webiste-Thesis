The key to layering is balance—ensure the two fragrances complement each other, rather than competing.",
                "Start by layering lighter, fresher scents first and build upon them with richer, more intense notes. For instance, pair a floral scent with a musky or woody perfume to add depth, or layer a citrus fragrance with a warm vanilla or amber for a cozy, inviting feel. Always test the combination on your skin before committing."

For work, consider choosing something subtle and fresh, like a citrus or light floral fragrance, which won't overpower your surroundings.",

For work or professional settings, stick to clean, neutral scents such as citrus, lavender, or green tea."

Start with a sweet base note like vanilla, caramel, or honey, and layer it with spicy notes such as cinnamon, clove, or cardamom. The sweetness adds warmth, while the spice gives the fragrance depth. Be mindful of the intensity of each scent to avoid overwhelming the senses.",
                "To balance sweet and spicy notes, try using a sweeter fragrance as the base and adding a spicy fragrance in moderation. For instance, a sweet vanilla or caramel fragrance pairs beautifully with a spicy cinnamon or pepper note, creating a warm and comforting blend. Ensure that one note doesn’t overpower the other.",
                "When combining sweet and spicy fragrances, think about how each note enhances the other. Spicy notes like ginger, cinnamon, or pepper add an exciting edge to sweet notes like vanilla, chocolate, or fruit. The key is to use each fragrance sparingly and find the right balance to create a harmonious and memorable scent."

If you have dry skin, you may need to apply more fragrance or layer it with a moisturizing lotion to help the scent last longer. On oily skin, fragrances may last longer but can sometimes become stronger or change more quickly. It's also important to consider fragrance families—lighter, fresher scents often perform better on dry skin, while deeper, richer scents can work well on oily skin.",

For oily skin, you can experiment with lighter, fresher fragrances, such as citrus or floral scents, but keep in mind they may evolve quicker on oily skin.",
                "To match fragrance with skin type, individuals with dry skin should look for rich, long-lasting perfumes with deep base notes such as vanilla, amber, or sandalwood.
